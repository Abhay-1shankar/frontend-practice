# Frontend Web Development Practice 🧠

This repository is a collection of all my hands-on HTML and CSS practice projects. I'm currently learning frontend development through project-based learning, applying concepts like Flexbox, Grid, CSS Animations, Transitions, and more.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `HTML/` — Basics of HTML, structure, tags, and formatting
- `CSS/` — Covers various CSS concepts such as:
  - `FLEXBOX/` — Flex layout examples
  - `GRIDS/` — Grid layout practices
  - `CSS Animations/` — Keyframe animation examples
  - `CSS Transitions/` — Transition property demos
  - `Design cards/` — UI design with cards using CSS
  - ... and more folders covering different topics

## 📌 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in HTML & CSS
- Practice modern layout techniques like Flexbox & Grid
- Explore animations, transitions, and responsive design
- Prepare for frontend development with clean project structure

## 🧠 Notes

Some folders may contain multiple `.html` files experimenting with different ideas.
Naming will become more consistent and documented as I grow.
